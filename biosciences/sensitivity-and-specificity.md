# Sensitivity and Specificity

**Sensitivity** is the percentage of people with the disease who correctly tested positive. It measures the test’s ability to correctly identify people who have the disease \(true vs. false positive\).

{% hint style="success" %}
90% sensitivity = 90% of people who have the disease will test positive.
{% endhint %}

**Specificity** is the percentage of people without the disease who correctly test negative. It measures the test’s ability to correctly identify people without the disease \(true vs. false negative\).

{% hint style="success" %}
e.g. 90% specificity = 90% of people who do not have the disease will test negative.
{% endhint %}

**Positive predictive value \(PPV\)** is the likelihood that a positive test indicates the presence of a disease, or the proportion of people with positive test results who actually have the disease.

$$PPV=\frac{\textsf{true positive}}{\textsf{true positive + false positive}}$$

**Negative predictive value \(NPV\)** is the likelihood that a negative test indicates the absence of a disease, or the proportion of people with negative test results who do not have the disease.

$$NPV=\frac{\textsf{true negative}}{\textsf{true negative + false negative}}$$

**Positive percent agreement \(PPA\)** is the proportion of reference positives that also receive positive results with the test method. It is the test’s ability to correctly identify the same positive cases as a reference method.

**Negative percent agreement \(NPA\)** is the proportion of a reference negatives that also receive negative results with the test method. It is the test’s ability to correctly identify the same negative cases as a reference method.
