#### Hand-Carried Goods

Commercial shipments that are not transported by a carrier qualify for release using the [Hand-Carried Goods \(HCG\) Release Process](https://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/import/release-dedouanement-eng.html). HCGs are exempted from eManifest and cargo conveyance requirements.

Examples of qualifying shipments include:

* Commercial goods carried by paying passengers on board traveller's commercial conveyances \(bus, taxi, plane, ship, ferry etc.\);
* Commercial goods being transported by and accounted for at the FPOA by the owner of a business, or an employee, driving a "not for hire," conveyance;
* Commercial shipments being imported into Canada by any individual who does not meet the criteria of "carrier" and who is not required under regulations to have, use and maintain a valid CBSA issued carrier code;

Documentation requirements:
