# Cognitive Distortions

The most common cognitive distortions include:

* mental filtering - negative filter & ignore positives
* polarization - the world is black and white
* overgeneralization - isolated negative event becomes downward spiral \("always\)
* discounting the positive
* jumping to conclusions
* catastrophizing
* personalization
* control fallacies
* fallacy of fairness
* blaming
* shoulds
* emotional reasoning
* fallacy of change
* global labeling
* always being right

#### Polarization

All-or-nothing. Black or white. Viewing things in absolute terms.

#### Mental Filtering

Isolated negative event becomes the sole focus, and all positive events are ignored.

e.g. Joe receives an excellent performance review with one constructive critcism. Joe fixates on the criticism, leaving him feeling miserable.

#### Overgeneralization

Isolated event becomes incorrectly applied to events across the board. Commonly appearing words: "never", "always".

e.g. Joe stubs his toe, "nothing ever goes my way!"

#### Discounting the Positive

Disregarding positive events and explaining them away as a fluke or anomaly.

e.g. Jane complimented Joe's hair. Joe thinks Jane is just being nice.
