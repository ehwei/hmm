# Document Generation

* [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/help/documentation/) is great at generating standardized documents, but custom formatting is difficult. There are packages available to add custom formatting, but the learning curve is a little too steep for what I'm interested in at this time. Also, documentation is sparse and popular packages can become unmaintained.
* [PyLaTeX](https://jeltef.github.io/PyLaTeX/current/) is a cool idea, but makes the rigid formatting requirements even more rigid. Perhaps another day.
* [weasyprint](https://weasyprint.org/) - open source visual rendering engine for HTML and CSS that can export to PDF and PNG
* [crabone](https://carbone.io/) - report generator from JSON to PDF, DOCX, XLSX, ODT, PPTX, ODS, XML, and CSV.
